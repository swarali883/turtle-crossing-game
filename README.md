# turtle-crossing-game

Here, we have a whole bunch of cars going across a super busy 
road and turtle is the player who has to cross the road. The 
gameplay looks like the figure shown below. The player controls 
the turtle which can only go forwards and thereâ€™s a whole bunch 
of randomly generated cars which are going horizontally across 
the screen. Now. Once a player reaches the other side of the 
screen, the cars speed up, but the player goes back to the starting 
position, ready to cross the screen again. Now at some point 
when the player turtle hits a car, then that is game over.
